# Lab Report 3 

## Part 1: Streamlining ssh Configuration
* Create a file called *config* in the `.ssh` folder if it doesn't yet exist. 
* Put the following lines into the *config* file using Notepad or any other code editor like VScode.
* The host name can be anything, but I chose to remain with ieng6.

* Then log into the ieng6 account with the command `ssh ieng6`. Now no account name and password are required to log into my course account.

* Then using the `scp` command, copy a file from the local computer to the server computer's home directory. Use `ls` to check that the file exists in the server's home directory.
